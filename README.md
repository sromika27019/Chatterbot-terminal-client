# Django ChatterBot Terminal Client

I built this project to give me a simple terminal-based chat interface backed by Django and ChatterBot. With one command, I can launch a REPL in my console and talk to my bot.

---

## Features

- I wrote a custom Django management command (`manage.py chat`) to run everything in the terminal.
- I integrated **ChatterBot** with the **BestMatch** logic adapter.
- I trained the bot on the standard English corpus so it can respond to basic greetings and small talk.
- I kept the code modular and commented in first-person so itâ€™s easy to follow what I did.
